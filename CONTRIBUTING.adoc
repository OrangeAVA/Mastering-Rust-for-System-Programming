Replace "your-username" with your GitHub username.

=== 3. Create a Branch for Local Development 🌿

Create a new branch for your local development with a descriptive name for your bug fix or feature:

[source,shell]
----
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
----

Now you can make your changes locally.

=== 4. Make Changes ✏️

Make the desired changes to the content or address any issues you've identified. Ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and coding standards.

=== 5. Test Your Changes 🧪

If applicable, test your changes to ensure they work as expected. This is especially important if you're updating or adding code in the Jupyter notebooks.

=== 6. Commit Your Changes ✅

Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. This helps maintain a clean and readable version history.

[source,shell]

----

=== 8. Create a Pull Request 🔀

Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes, and our team will review your PR as soon as possible.

== Additional Contribution Opportunities 💡

Aside from content improvements, you can also contribute by keeping the libraries code in each Jupyter notebook up-to-date. Ensure that dependencies and libraries are bumped to the latest versions for a better learning experience.
